# CaffeineScript

### Introduction

Welcome to the CaffeineScript programming language; a language to precisely specify your favourite coffee drink so we can make it **exactly** the way you want it!

### How to write a program

Lines of code in CaffeineScript have the following form:
\<verb\> \<quantity\> \<ingredient\>; 
where \<verb\> is any English verb (describing how to add the ingredient in question), \<quantity\> is 
a number followed by a word to specify how much of the ingredient to add, and \<ingredient\> is the name of 
the ingredient. For example, in the line `add 2 shots of espresso`, `add` is the verb, `2 shots` is the quantity, and
`espresso is the ingredient`.
A program in CaffieneScript is simply a sequence of lines of code!

### How to run a program

You can run a program by typing the following into your terminal (when located in the top level directory of the CaffeineScript project) `sbt run "project caffeinescript" "run path/to/file"` where `path/to/file` is the path to the script you wish to run.
